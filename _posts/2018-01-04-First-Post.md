description: The first post on this website.

Today, I post the first post on this website.
But, there are some questions:

* What's the purpose of this website ?
* Who am I ?

In this first post, I will answer these questions.

Who am I ?
----------

I'm a 21-years-old swiss computer engineering student.
I'm obviously fond of computing science and I like photograpy too.
I'm not an english speaker as my mother tongue is French. So, I will make some mistakes.

What's the purpose of this website ?
------------

First, as you can think when watching the Projects and Curriculum page,
this website main goals is to be an exhibition of my works and schoolar path.

Second, I decide to use this webiste for host some of my graphical works, mainly photographies,
and a blog, as I always wanted one.

I will speak about technical parts of this site in other posts later.
But, I will tease you by telling that this website is hosted on the GitHub page services and is build with Jekyll.
